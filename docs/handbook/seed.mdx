## What are SEEDs?

SEEDs are awarded based on your XP. More specifically, your XP earned per week through direct actions as well as the XP that flows to your past contributions as people engage with them over time. As a result MetaGamers are playing an iterated game with long-term incentives for collaboration. You receive points for making it easy for others to use and contribute to your contributions. This creates a living ecosystem of value. More value, more XP, more SEEDs.  

## The SEED Market

The SEED market exists to support value creation. By giving people a way to buy and sell SEEDs we create a community currency. This allows MetaGamers to earn things like character profiles, earn membership/ governance rights, and the ability to support the valuable work of others in a postiive-sum way (boosting).  

MetaGame will create a market on a bonding curve and buy up the initial supply. This will create a price floor. A small fee will be charged to people exiting out of the SEED market, however all SEED transactions within the Metaverse will have full value. This incentivizes local engagement and spending within the MetaGame universe. 

SEEDs will be allocated to contributors on a weekly basis. The goal is to have more SEEDs coming in through profile creation, membership dues, and in-game features than there are going out via SEED allocations. In this way MetaGame has a runway of SEEDs to support the community until SEED demand eclipses supply. Then number go up.
