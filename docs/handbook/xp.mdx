title: ðŸ§¬ XP 
---

Experience points (XP) can be earned by anyone anytime by engaging on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZqdPP9b), writing on [Discourse](https://metagame.trydiscourse.com/), and laying down code on [GitHub](https://github.com/metafam/), or completing a Quest. You earn XP when you create content and/or when people reference or react to your content. We also have Initiatives to recognize contributions that happened off-line and reward them with XP as well. 

Due to the way SourceCred works (PageRank) the more XP you have the more weight your engagement has. This creates a soft sybil resistance where random accounts or profiles can't easily embed themselves into the contribution graph without actually contributing. 

Because XP is earned via contributions and engagement, which are always fluctuating, XP scores are always fluctuating. They are not fixed. Think of them more like an element or the weather. XP is very real, and has very real properties and effects, but it's more of a force of nature than anything.
