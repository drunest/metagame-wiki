## 📜Block #13

Thought it’d be good to give y’all a longer rundown of all the progress rather than just these bullet points. So here’s just a few:
- Seeds pump even harder, almost quadrupling since the last newsletter.
- MyMeta makes good progress towards full realization.
- The effect of The Purge continues: the number of active players increases, while the total number of players actually decreases. 😱

## 📜Block #12


- We got invited to join the Panvala matching league! Thanks Niran! 🥰
- We received a couple grand from Commons Stack’sPanvala matching pool prize. Griff himself joins the Patrons of MetaGame. Welcome, fam! ✌️
- Following up on last week’s interview with Kevin, we started brainstorming on possible ways to collaborate. Something interesting might be brewing between Gitcoin & MetaGame 🙃
- Exciting news about the podcast itself coming in the next few days as well. The upcoming episode with Magenta of Bloom Network should air tomorrow, but the episode itself is kind of a beginning 👀
- Jason Yin translates the wiki to Mandarin and kicks-off MetaGame China then brings in a bunch of students & teachers with whom he is building a college for entrepreneurs in Beijing - hoping to integrate learnings from MetaGame 😱
- The MyMeta funding proposal to the MetaCartel was a success! 💸 We’ll soon start using those funds to buy back Seeds from the builders and adding them to the liquidity pool! Good progress made on profiles themself.
- Some of the notables reactivating or joining are Luke of 1Hive as a Patron, Vanmoortel as both a Patron & an Inner Circle player & Alec the latest high skill builders but also a bunch of old hodlors checking-in & adding liquidity.
- MetaGame got listed on Coingecko & Seeds had their first pump. 🤩 Currently sitting at $22, up from $18 yesterday, up from $9 on Wednesday, up from $6 since the pool launch - not bad.
- Frens: dump the pump.


Finally, as you might already be aware, Dunbar’s limit on Players was hit a while ago and we’ve been regularly cleaning the membership…
So far we’ve only kicked out ~20/150 people, but we’re currently 10 members over the cap due to the MetaGame China players & the waitlist has gotten significantly longer yesterday. Expect the purges to accelerate. 😬


## 📜Block #11
- The new podcast episode is live! MetaView #9 - Owocki of Gitcoin on Public Goods Funding, Onboarding & Rewarding Systems.
- The Wiki continues receiving a stream of updates. After a full remake of the intro, roadmap & how to play - main navigation page receives a major facelift. 👇
- mZ writes up a bunch of proposals up on the forums. Proposal #0: Minimum Viable Proposal Procedure, Proposal #1: Cap Issuance Rate of New Seeds & Proposal #2: Treasury Seed Buy Back Policy - go share your thougths.
- Based on popular demand on clarity about the XP & Seed system, the post has been rewritten from ~750 words down to ~450, now with much more clarity. 👇
- The new Seed Market has been live running for ~5 days now with up to $22.4k liquidity - not bad for an ~$80k marketcap token!
- The minting of the next batch of Seeds is underway!
- A few more people lose their player status 😬.
Note:
- Don’t forget to plant & water your Seeds. 🙏

Go check it out?

## 📜Block #10
- An all new onboarding system. As mentioned already, we’re no longer just letting everybody in. No more intro quests either - sign up through here instead.
- More people proceed not to sell us any Seeds? Damn it y’all.
- Continued upgrading Discord: Reordered & deleted channels. Updated descriptions & added emojis. Added a new channel: #🚨issues-n-ideas.
- A few people came to present their projects to the community & they were pretty cool - you should have been there 😜
- We continued tying up the wiki into something more coherent & prettier to look at. A new landing page merging “intro” & all 3 types coming. Copy below.
- Submitted a $5k proposal to the MetaCartel 🤞
- The Stoa kindly hosted my MG talk and it was awesome. Never met such an engaged audience - spoke for 10 minutes then answered questions for another 45.
- Luxumbra moves up to Golden Fam 😱
- A few more people lose their memberships, and Tweetious becomes the first one to receive the Protected Player role - obtained by hodling 20+ Seeds.
- Finalized all we needed to know about the new balancer smart pool thanks to mZ. Launch imminent; next Seed minting t-3 days.
- As requested through the last newsletter’s poll, the long term vision of MetaGame has been laid out in the new Phases of MetaGame. 👇

## 📜Block #9
- The MyMeta flow is now connected to the back-end, means you can finally permanently upgrade your profile with goodies such as personality type & skills.
- We had a call oriented around upgrading the wiki last week. It resulted in a lot of discussion and only going through ~10% of the wiki, so we decided to do it async.
- We’re in talks with the Balancer team, setting up a smart pool to allow us to later change the pool parameters through the DAO vs the currnet set-forever pool.
- We got the Zerion team to list Seeds on Zerion!
- Kay built a new embassy, this time bridging MetaGame comms to Sourcecred.
- I did a lot of thinking & writing on the framing of MetaGame and the onboarding system. From a new intro, through this how-to-play, to the onboarding guide, etc.
- Recorded a new MetaRadio episode, this one with Stani of Aave - then realized the recording cuts off after the first 2 minutes. 🤦‍♂️ Kevin of Gitcoin next up!
- We launched Achievmintry, an achievement minting DAO, in collaboration with the Raid Guild & MetaCartel. Moar soon.
- 10 players lose their player status as 10 new people join. Yes, the curation is real.
Kind of a slow week tbh.

Onto the main topic:

## 📜Block #8
- Hammad switches us to Vercel allowing for more dynamic change-making, implements imgix to make the site load faster & deploys the whole thing to a permanent domain - MyMeta is now live! 😱
- We had another call with 3Box, Raid Guild & 1Hive to get updated on the latest from 3Box and hopefully follow up by joining forces on building MyMeta.
- We also got two more developers join the MyMeta team; ECWireless & Damjan.
- But we need moar. MOAR DEVELOPERS.
- Luxumbra does a complete redesign of the wiki, with some help from Saimano in removing useless things & me in throwing a bunch of ideas up the wall. Made it look as slick as MyMeta; screenshots below.
- Vanilla graduates our announcements channel into an actual announcements channel, allowing others to subscribe to it. Also makes the meta-announcements channel aka #📣-metaphone live, after adding DAOHaus & MetaMedia to a full list of guilds it is subscribed to - Raid Guild, 1Hive, LexDAO & MetaFactory.
- Topping it off, he also added a bunch of new roles and the #role-select channel to help us target the right players for announcements and calls to action.
- Go pick yourself a role! 🙃
- I added a channel too #my-thing - for you to shill your startup, project or whatever hobby or skill you’re working on! 🤗
- New podcast episode is live! This time we talked to Griff Green of Commons Stack on topics ranging from community-building, values in the Ethereum space and the broader crypto space drama.
- Then on the 27th of October, I’ll be getting interviewed myself - forThe Stoa. 😮

## 📜Block #7
Last week we sent out a newsletter asking y’all to sell your Seeds to us so that we can use them to provide liquidity. Surprisingly, nobody wants to sell their Seeds. Out of 12,295 Seeds minted for 55 people, only 2 people were willing to sell some. A grand total of 275 Seeds - 186 of which were picked up by an unknown address. 😅
This makes us both happy & sad. Happy, because it shows that most of you still have faith in MetaGame. Sad, because it means we might have to mint Seeds for liquidity after all. Should we? (only players can access the linked channel)
Onwards:
- Dan13 added skills to MyMeta profiles & made good progress on the profile creation flow.
- Vanilla added a meta-announcements channel and connected it to 4 other discords: Raid Guild, 1Hive, LexDAO & MetaFactory.
- Also added the “!?token” & “!?quests” to the list of bot command bringing up useful info.
- Peth wrote a page about DAOs, explaining what they are with all the links & resources.
- Also fixed the images on the front page of the wiki, formatting on a bunch of articles & added the DAO canvas page.
- Saimano did some work on updating the design of the wiki, Luxumbra taking the reins & hopefully submitting a PR tonight.
- Kay built the first embassy, creating a direct communications channel between MetaGame & 1Hive.
- YoungKidWarrior built a BrightID verification bot for Discord.
- Ben.oxmo built a bot for Sourcecred to relay cred scores & stats to Discord channels and players, allowing us to significantly shorten the feedback loop

## 📜Block #6
Yep yee! It’s that time again!
- We minted a bunch of Seeds for anyone who ever contributed to MetaGame! 😮
- You might have gotten some without even knowing - check yoself.
- You might have deserved some but didn’t get any - let us know.
- If you used the #set-eth-address on our Discord, you probably have some Seeds now.

## 📜Block #5

- On Friday calls we set up the agenda for the week.
- Seeing people tend to… Not really do what they say they’ll do; I started regularly checking up on people and asking about their progress.
Yesterday was that day. Today, I woke up to a response from one of the core contributors asking to be removed from the inner circle. 😦
- I like being angry more than I like being sad - the angry energy is easier to put to good use while sadness usually just makes me unproductive.
Anyway, here’s what he said:

lack of project management
Ascribing this to my lack of experience. When starting MetaGame, I was 100% aware of my incompetence at doing something as complex as this. What made me take the leap is my hope that, it being “a DAO”, more competent people will naturally rise up to the challenge & fill in the gaps.
Disclosure: At first, I was even naive enough to think the projects will be autonomous, not require management & the people working on them will just manage themselves. 😂
I believe it is because of lack of incentives
Seeds are not distributed regularly neither have understandable value
Its truly been far too long since we last minted Seeds. The gas prices were crazy and we were endlessly debating moving to xDAI or other layer2 solutions. We also underestimated people’s patience for receiving Seeds based on it not mattering to Hammad & I.
We’ll be moving forward with Seed minting in the next few days. If you haven’t already, register your eth address in the #set-eth-address channel.
If you received the Seeds already and want to sell them without crashing the price on Uniswap, contact me @petheth.
It’s been a year and I don’t think metagame moved far, or got any significant traction.
This is the bit that actually hurts me. I’m painfully aware that even though we did do a bunch of things, the technical progress has been damn slow.
My problem: Trying to figure out whether its me that’s the problem, my lack of ability managing the project, explaining it, promoting it etc. or is MetaGame simply something people don’t care about?
Help me figure it out, please.
Click one of these:
Nobody cares about MetaGame.
Nobody understands MetaGame.
I don’t want to cling on to it if nobody cares about it, I can give it up.

## 📜Block #4
Wut Happened?
We spent the last call going through how the Navigation Board works, what raids are there & assigning players to lead them.
- At the beginning of the call, I (peth) was the only one on the map.
- By the end of the call, there were only 4/14 spots left in the inner circle. 😶

I’ll tell you more about the raids in a second, let’s jump through the evolution of the Navigation Board first.
Entering the new phase, the slate has been wiped clean.
Now, it is time to (re)introduce our old friend - The Navigation Board. 🙃

## 📜Block #3
Let me explain it first!
First thing you should know is that The Navigation Board is based on Doughnut Economics - a 21st century world-improving compass.
The main indicator of human progress we have been using is the growth of GDP, Kate Raworth (among many others) claims that using GDP growth as the main metric of progress is not just stupid but downright dangerous. 😬
Forever-growing GDP is not only a bad proxy for wellbeing, but one that leads to exploitation and, left unchecked, to the destruction of ecosystems. She proposes a different framework for navigating towards a better future.
🛑 Spoiler: It’s about measuring things that actually matter:

Her book contains a lot of insights that make you go “hell yeah!”, but digging deeper into it is besides the point of this post. If you’re interested in learning more about it, just read the damn thing. Also, here’s how Amsterdam & Copenhagen adopted it.
Alright, ready?
Here’s how it translates to our Navigation Board:

Gray circle, nodes outside or close to it are not actively being worked on.
Green circle, raids on the green line are progressing at an optimal rate.
Red circle, getting close to it means a raid is under-resourced or stalling.
A player node, casting spells on nearby raids.
A yellow raid node, just something we’re working on.
A purple node, just useful links.
An orange raid node, a high priority initiative.
MetaGame Realization Crystal & its health bar.
The Navigation Board exists to give MetaGame players an easy overview & context of what’s going on. Simply open it to get an at-a-glance understanding of what initiatives are there, what their status is & who the players working on them are.
Now, getting added to the inner circle is an honor that nets you more money & respect but! bears responsibility. If you pledge to start casting a spell on one of the initiatives, you will be expected to *actually do it* & report on your progress regularly.

## 📜Block #2


Last week’s newsletter was all about The Octo’s birthday and our achievement since it’s conception; now it’s time to give you an update on the ongoing initiatives.
Octo Birthday Party
Let’s start with the birthday party you should regret not-attending; it was pretty damn cool. These spatial audio sort of environments are about as close as we can get to recreating the IRL mingling of meetups in virtual environments. (it’s kind of why we’re building MetaVille)
For the most part, there were ~20 people engaging in 3-4 conversation-circles, with many more people dropping by for a while to say hello & check out the venue. If you want to know what we talked about, you should have been there 😝
Here’s one shot from when the people started arriving, before forming conversation circles etc. After that, things just got too wild for me to be taking pictures.


## 📜Block #1

Happy Birthday MetaGame! 🎂🎉🎊🎈
- Damn, has it been that long already?
Yessir!
- And what have you done?
A major part of the first year was spent defining what exactly MetaGame is, what its goals are, what it requires on the technical side of things and how it would actually work. It took a lot of talking & a lot of writing it out.
We’re far from figuring everything out, but we’ve come far enough to have built up the knowledge base, set up the basic rewards & economic system, built the first version of MyMeta and prototyped MetaMaps & MetaVille.
Other than figuring things out & setting the foundations, I’d say most of the time was spent finding the right people and building the community. Could have went the more traditional way of raising money & offering paychecks, but doing it this way we stayed true to our philosophy & attracted the missionaries - not mercenaries.

Alright, let’s get into some achievements:
- First presented on a crypto meetup (October 2019)
- First raid party - seeding MetaGame cards (Devcon, October 2019)
- First bots deployed (November 2019)
- XP System implemented (SourceCred, December 2019)
- First achievement NFTs minted (Mintbase, January 2020)
- First website launched (February 2020)
- First version of Interspace deployed (February 2020)
- First presentation on a conference (ETHCC, March 2020)
- First to do a virtual conference in the Ethereum space (InterCon, March 2020)
- Seed Market launched (April 2020)
- First life affected (May 2020)
- Organized the first DAO hackathon (Fork The World, July 2020)
- Reached Closed Beta (August 2020)
- First version of MyMeta built (August 2020)
- First version of MetaMaps built (August 2020)
- Aaand some numbers up until now:

Number #3 most funded in Gitcoin's CLR round 4
- 6 podcast episodes published
- 15 articles written
- 51 newsletters delivered
- 62 meetups held
- 137 registered contributors
- 217 contributors to our gitcoin grant
- 376 people receiving our newsletters
- 751 people on our discord
- 1062 people following us on twitter
- $20k+ raised in grants
- $50k+ worth of Seeds minted
- Over 9000 funs had

I know you’re used to seeing bigger numbers from all of these shiny new defi platforms, but it’s a bit harder to attract the people & capital when you’re not offering the prospects of getting rich quick 😅
Consider also that MetaGame was started by a one man team, an ex-plumber-dude with no entrepreneurial experience - and it all makes more sense, doesn’t it? This dumbass had to spend majority of his time convincing others that building MetaGame is worth their time.
To be fair, talented & competent did join MetaGame, but the problem is that all of them have been working on it as a side thing. Unable to pay their bills, MetaGame can’t compete with their main focus of attention.

**🚧 Genesis - week 30**

My inspiration reaches ATH
A huge thank you to everyone who came up during the past few days; reactivated on Discord & Discourse, sent me DMs, shown up on the Friday community call, submitted PRs, suggested improvements or took up challenges & raids.
You are the reason I am doing this. 🤗
By all measures, The Octo has successfully been re-awakened from the slumber.
…To be completely honest, I was a bit worried given the projects that lose momentum rarely make it back. Luckily, meme is strong with this one.
I’m more optimistic than ever that we can do this.
There’s a lot more to say on all of this, but I’ll keep it for the Octo’s birthday post 🙃

 🚧 Genesis - week 29
A bunch of people contacted me in the last couple of days, worried they will get kicked out for being inactive.
And you still think we’re joking?
No.
Although there was a serious uptick in the activity on the Discord, Discourse & Github since the last week’s post, this is not enough.
Why?
There’s much too much to build.
Step 1
Relax, we’re not just going to start kicking people out. Some people currently have too much on their plates (which we can relate to), and for others there simply isn’t much they can do to help us push MetaGame forward - but they’re all still our people.
So, let’s keep it simple. As mentioned earlier, playing MetaGame isn’t about contributing to MetaGame directly, but about improving yourself & doing things that improve the world around you in general.
To be considered an active player, you simply need to come to the MetaGame discord about once a week, open the #check-in channel & tell us: “I’ve been working on X”, “I’ve been learning about Y”, “I’m having trouble with Z” or something similar.
Step 2

If you want to actually earn some money & maybe end up ranked as one of the founders of MetaGame, you’ll have to actually take up some work on MetaGame itself.
Luckily for you, there’s no lack of work in MetaGame.



🚧 Genesis - week 28
Seed market was the final piece of MetaGame’s core economic system, closing the gap between passive supporters & the people actively contributing to the realization of MetaGame. With the Seed market running for about a month without major price drops, MetaGame has quietly rolled into a closed beta phase.
What do you mean “closed”? 😱
What it means is that non-players are now only able to see the most basic channels - and that’s the people who already are on Discord. It also means we’ll be getting more picky around who gets to join.
MetaGame becomes invite-only.
The reason for this is twofold:
With the recent launch of the Seed market & the general heating up of the bull market, there’s an increasing number of people who are in it for the money - not our people.
Thus far, MetaGame has mostly been about building an ever larger community, but scaling communities doesn’t work like that - it only turns communities into crowds.
To get MetaGame to the next stage, we believe, requires a small number of highly committed individuals - more so than a crowd of people who “kinda like it”. We don’t need the people who say “metagame is so cool”, we need the people who say that and actually help push it forward.
We already had the 1st lurker publicly disappointed about losing his ability to read our channels on Discord, but so what. If you like what MetaGame is about & want to be a part of it - contribute. 
MetaGame is not a place where you can come in and just passively consume other people’s thoughts & brainstorms - that was Web2. MetaGame is about getting actively involved in building the future. It’s a movement, not a statement - if that makes any sense?
More importantly, we’re closing it because we want to focus on making the community tighter & the connections within stronger. 
We were focused outwards & now it’s time to focus inwards.

🚧 Genesis - week 27

We were saddened to see that so much money would be returned to the sponsors vs. given to great hackers - so we’ve extended Fork The World for another 5 days!
There’s things to learn & money to be made - so let’s keep it going!


🚧 Genesis - week 26
We have entered the second half of the DAO Hack Month.
It brings us… Well, if you already know all of that, you can just go straight to Discord.
Fork The World 2020

The meme of Fork The World is to push forward the movement towards decentralized societies.
Posing a question: Do we really need CEOs, presidents & vice-presidents?
Nation States & Facebook? Maybe.
Maybe not 🤷
The goal of this hackathon isn't for you to hack on our projects for money, the goal of this hackathon is for you to start building your own project & a DAO. As you can see by the agenda, there is almost everything one might need for doing so, from designing a product & a DAO, to choosing a framework & engineering a token.
But we do also offer ways for easy money 🙃


🚧 Genesis - week 25

DAO Hack Month / Fork The World
Since the announcement of the Fork The World hackathon, we joined forces with Aragon to form the DAO Hack Month.
Well, Aragon kicked off the DAO Hack Month a few days ago, so what’yer waitin’ for? Join us on Discord!
There’s some sweet bounties going:
A Curated NFT Gallery DAO
A Curated Media Publication DAO
A Social DAO
Easier DAO Onboarding
An Aragon Court Governance Dashboard
A Transaction Path Chooser
And something using Wyre’s widget & API.
If none of that sounds appealing to build, here’s a sneak peak into the first 3 days of Fork The World, starting in 9 days:

Join the opening event through here.



🚧 Genesis - week 24

Going on for 2 hours with almost 30 people, SourceCred x MetaGame meetup was 🔥! If you missed it, you could at least listen to this podcast episode where we interviewed Decentralion. Which brings me to…


🚧 Genesis - week 23

Today marks the 4th anniversary since the downfall of the first DAO the world has seen. With the goal of funding the Ethereum ecosystem development, it attracted 11.5m ETH or $2.7 billion in today’s money.
Due to incessant hack attacks, it soon started leaking gas and the whole thing blew up. Grown-ups wept like toddlers, Ethereum was forked, faith was lost and a dark age for DAOs had begun…


🚧 Genesis - week 22

Let’s just get straight into it:
First things first, we’re doing a SourceCred x MetaGame meetup on Monday 15th, 11am PST - be there.
We summoned the DAO last week! Disregarding the gas & tx problems, it was pretty damn epic. The attendees got this sweet sweet achievement NFT:

Hammad wanted to start distributing Seeds yesterday, but turned out there’s a minor bug to be fixed in SourceCred first 🤷‍♂️
Also, if your contribution is missing or you think it hasn’t been properly accounted for, get in touch through Discord!
Profiles took a step back as we went through a design sprint; defining all the needed elements & the profile creation flow. You can check the new flow here.
That How MetaGame Works post was published.
The How to Play thread was updated & more people completed the intro quests.
Then there was this feedback form…

🚧 Genesis - week 21
In a recent poll, you told us you mainly want more guild building resources & understanding of how MetaGame works. Well, we shared some guild building wisdom with you, and now we’re onto “how MetaGame works”.
We already told you about the XP & Seeds system, now it’s time we tell you how those and all the other pieces fit together to make MetaGame work.




🚧 Genesis - week 20

When thinking about high performance teams, we tend to pin the outcome on things like skill, experience and intelligence - predictors of individual performance. While those are certainly important, it turns out they’re not the most important when it comes to teams.
This dude Daniel spent a lot of time with teams ranging from Navy SEALs to NBA Spurs to Pixar & IDEO, and found these three ingredients to be the most important in making teams successful: 
Establishing a purpose
Sharing vulnerability
Building safety
Not exactly what you’d expect, aye? Let’s dig deeper.


🚧 Genesis - week 19
Don’t want to make a big fuss about it, but some of the things we recently did add up to a big step forward in the realizing of MetaGame.
We decided to call this the Alpha 2 version of MetaGame, quietly rolled it out last week, made sure everything works & are now ready to start taking in more traffic from you, fresh & stale lurkers alike 🙃
Changelog
Some of these have already been explained and we’ll dive deeper into the rest of them below; in short:
NPC for quest completions fully operational
The new Seed DAO live on testnet
Fully migrated to the XP system
Revamped on-boarding system
New meetup sessions added
All raids progressed
New raid added
New quests up
Secret quest :o


🚧 Genesis - week 18
This one is all about you, dear member of the MetaGame community!
Ok, alright, not entirely! We’ll give you a short status update for starters, but after that it’s all about you.
What
Welcoming new members, answering questions about the latest update, and giving a quick overview of the next steps.
Other than that, the community call this Friday will mostly be about you!
Whether you’ve been around MetaFam for a while, or are just getting into the MetaGame community - it’s time for you to tell us about your project :)
We want to hear about your startup, your new baby, your long term project, your weekend project or whatever you might be working on!

🚧 Genesis - week 17
After many weeks of deliberation, bug fixing, and data wrangling, we finally have a working Quest system to give XP for all the work that was done on MetaGame prior to integrating SourceCred, as well as all the work done that wasn’t tracked properly.
This also makes it helluva lot easier for community members to earn XP by contributing to MetaGame in more meaningful way than just Discord, forum & GitHub interactions.
Now that we have all of that sorted, it’s time to shed some light on how the system works & dispell all the confusion around it.





🚧 Genesis - week 16

Setting the record straight
Intercon - it’s been a long time, but the Initiatives plugin for Sourcecred is finally ready and we imported past work. If you’re already registered on the forums, you should be able to see your name updated with XP here.
Manu, Drew, DeFi Dude & whoever else - if you’re reading this, drop in the forums.
If you joined in the past ~2-3 months & think sourcecred hasn’t registered your contribution properly - which is very possible - just let us know :)
If you’re just wondering WTF is InterCon, read this.


🚧 Genesis - week 15

Crown Jewel of Meme Driven Development
ETH is money, Ethereum is a State, dApps are public utilities; we are global citizens.
What drew us under this banner is a strong meme that Ethereum is a critical piece of technology to be used for building better socioeconomic systems & infrastructure. 
On our way here, we’ve also realized it’s not really about Ethereum but about us, the community. It’s not Ethereum that made us global citizens, it’s the realization that the nation states we’re born under define us about as much as the socks we wear.
We are here because we believe there is an opportunity to do things better, and we’ll be doing that no matter what technological or non-technological means it takes. We are the optimistic new kids on the block. Let’s play.
“Metagame, or game about the game, is any approach to a game that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game.”



🚧 Genesis - week 14
Hey, hey, heeeeeYYYY!
On a more serious note, we are doing things.
It seems like things have really started accelerating over at MetaFam 😱. I started pushing this rock up a hill alone but now I’m surrounded by a bunch of awesome people 🥰😍
Here’s what’s up:
The MetaManifesto is written and about to be published, just waiting for a bit of feedback, from you. Drop some comments on how to make it better/less cringe🙏
Wrote the broad overview of the Phases of MetaGame on the forums. Again, any feedback welcome.
Updated the on-boarding system, go learn more about the intro quests & possible roles here.
Hammad launched the Wiki, could use some work on migrating content there.
Paco & Mano are working on the player profiles. The back-end of connecting your identities is almost done, now onto design & hooking it up to the front-end.
Mark & Hammad are working on the Discord bots that will be giving out quests, setting roles and doing other useful things.
Sourcecred team is finishing the Initiatives plugin, will soon allow us to run the questing system more efficiently.
AraCred (Sourcecred to Aragon integration) team is almost done, so we’ll soon be migrating to a new DAO and consolidating Seeds.
The Seed Market research phase is almost finished, the Seeds will soon be tradeable on Uniswap.
Started preliminary work on the Skill Trees.
Preparations for Interspace v2 & the mobile app started, more info soon.
Finally, redone the Navigation Board. From an unreadable jumble that we had, into something more understandable:

I said more understandable, not understandable. It’s understandable you don’t understand it. Go to this post if you do want to understand it.
If you see something on the board you’d like to help it, get in touch.



🚧 Genesis - week 13
As you may already know:
Raising ~1400$ in contributions & ~7500$ in matching funds; MetaGame was one of the top funded projects of the last Gitcoin funding round.
If you're wondering what have we done since the last round; we launched the website, the first version of MetaGame, organized a virtual conference & onboarded a bunch of people 🙃
You may read more about all of that in the "6 Months of MetaGame".
- Is that all you did with all of that money???
No, not really. In fact, we only spent ~500$ so far 😁
We actually only received the last round funds a few days ago, so…
However; Yalor and I combined spent upwards of 40 hours shilling the gitcoin grant & engaging with people 1on1. The community has grown significantly since, and we want to experiment with doing this campaign differently 🤓


It’s been just over 6 months since I came home from ETHBerlin with a head full of memes, and started working on MetaGame. Thought I’d share the story of MetaGame so far.

peth.eth 🐙
@petheth
Think this might be the most inspired I've EVER been. Thank you @meta_cartel, thank you @odyssyautomaton, @MolochDAO, @dappcon_berlin and @ETHBerlin. Huge thank you to everyone at MCMansion, people hiking yesterday and @pet3rpan_. Fucking love you #metafam!

Here’s what I came home with:

Now, MetaGame is of course nowhere close to built, but the progress is apparent.
As a non-technical person starting a complex technical project, my sole focus needed to be communicating the vision of MetaGame and building a community of believers willing to step up and start building it.
As a non-venture-backed person, I needed to build the meme of MetaGame so compelling as to have complete strangers from the internet work on it for free.
This was no easy task, but I have reasons to believe we have reached the tipping point.



🚧 Genesis - week 12
Wow, where to begin with the last 2 weeks of Corona packed, market tanking, global pandemic activity ????actually I guess that’s a good start 🤦🏻‍♀️

TL:DR lots of things have been happening but this has not swayed the faith and vigilance of the MetaGame technicions, nope we’re in the lab because we believe now is an even better time to double down on our efforts at re-aligning global incentives, developing new ways to manage work & reward allocation, and weaving fractured global landscapes back together. 
The meeting time is 6PM UTC, 7PM CET, 1PM EST on Friday March 20th, 2020.
Join us in the House of Adoption 🏘 on Interspace 👈🏼📲👉🏼 Direct link for Mobile.

🚧 Genesis - week 11
It’s happening 🧟‍♂️ we don’t know exactly what, or how, all we know is that word has been spreading like a virus. With so many new MetaGame players catching the Quest fever might need to make the Bi-monthly meeting a Bi-weekly *more meetings sigh*

Never fear our trusty resident alien pΞTHerum has organized a fookin awesome event the Friday following this weeks web-connect *The 13th* 👻
It’s called “InterCon —The Virtual Conference”
As for us we’ve got a boatload of topics to cover in this weeks agenda! The meeting time is 6PM UTC, 7PM CET, 1PM EST on Friday March 6th, 2020. Meet us in the House of Adoption 🏘 in Interspace. 👈🏼 If you don’t know this is a real place, where dreams come true, with sick tunes, just click the link.
🚧 Genesis - week 10
#ETHdenver raid was a great success ⚔️! Our inboxes are overflowing, and the Discord is filled with chatter of new people trying to understand and join our cause.
They’ve been completing the first quest and making the ranked Founder leaderboard competitive. It is no longer enough to complete the first Quest to qualify 😱
Leaderboard
A bunch of people making moves up the leaderboard, most notably:
Burrrata coming in hot! Leaping from #17 Golden skipping Platinum over to #6 Diamond Founder rank, keep it up!
Gus, steadily up from #8 to #7, enough to step up from Platinum up to the Diamond league.
Flashmob, appearing last week on #53 Bronze, to jump to #15 Golden league flirting with Platinum.

🚧 Genesis - week 9

We only briefly touched on these in the last post, so decided to write a new post dedicated to getting into more detail on Quests, Achievements & Interspace.
MetaGame.wtf
A few days following the closing of our (massively successful) Gitcoin campaign, Hammad went ahead and deployed us the first version of the website - MetaGame.wtf

He imbued it with the sweet Synthwave 80s aesthetic, which will almost certainly be the theme for the first version of MetaGame, with all of it’s pixel art niceties.
It’s nothing fancy (yet) except maybe for that animation he dropped in the middle, but it’s all we need for now. It explains MetaGame in one short sentence, and directs people to either Play (by joining us on Discord) or Learn (by reading the 8 pillar articles for understanding MetaGame).


🚧 Genesis - week 8

Things have been picking up pace since the Gitcoin campaign. If you contributed there, thank you once again & please do claim your rewards.
What's new? Most notably:
We launched the website a few days after the campaign closed
We launched the ChievMint Factory, for all our achievement NFT minting needs
Kay joins the MetaFam and launches a virtual conferencing tool - Interspace
We recorded & preparing to launch the first podcast episode on the MetaRadio
We redone the on-boarding system, drop by our Discord
We’ll be at ETHDenver, building the character creation flow and player profiles


🚧 Genesis - week 7

🚧 Genesis - week 6
First things first, we need your DAI 🤑

MetaGame founders have posted the following grant in the Gitcoin CLR matching round 4 for the continued development of the platform.  

Fund The Grant

Our goal is to maximize our multiplier by getting as many individuals to contribute to our campaign as possible. It’s not about how much you give, it’s that you give. Because every DAI = x47 DAI of matching funds at the current rate. 

YES THAT’S 47 DAI FOR EACH 1 DAI YOU CONTRIBUTE !!!

And as the amount of humans who contribute goes up, so does the multiplier ! At the time of writing matching funds available for this grant are astonishing:



🚧 Genesis - week 5
Happy New Year to the lurkers, the workers, and the MetaGame twurkers 👾
We’ve got a design sprint happening tommorow Jan 2, at 10 AM PST, 7PM CET, 6 PM UTC. Hammad will be running us through a collaborative brainstorming session to determine the concrete goals and direction for MetaGame for Q1 2020.
If you don’t know Hammad yet this is the perfect moment to see what one of the key MG thinkers has been dreaming up for the platform.
Jump To Meeting Room
He has written up a one page brief on what to expect for the session:
What To Expect
Don’t worry too much about what you have to do as we will be going through this all in the call 📲 basically this is a great opportunity for all the lurkers to share your thoughts and get inspiration for what you can do to help MG get off the ground 🛸

🚧 Genesis - week 3
Inching us closer to making MetaGame real & more like a game…
We’re introducing Weekly Quests and Daily Challenges.
For now, these are exclusively about making MetaGame a reality, and making you one of the Founding Fathers or Mothers.
🧙‍♂️ This week revolves around two main quests:
Upgrade the current web design on Figma
Create a character creation or finished-profile wireframe
Go over to Figma or wherever you want to do it, and take a stab at the first ever MetaGame quest - we’ll make sure you get some Seeds and perhaps a “completed the first quest ever” achievement NFT depending on how well you do.
✅ After you’re done, report back to the social-accounting channel and await your reward ;)
To learn more and stay in the loop on the daily challenges and additional weekly quests, drop by the square.
Here’s a sample of daily challenges:
Distribute MetaGame content through the interwebz (reddit, steemit or wherever you see fit)
Recruit a contributor (and make as much Seeds as they do for the first ? days)
Think of a new challenge 🤷‍♂️


🚧 Genesis - week 2
First off thanks to everyone for your continued discussion in the discord channel. We have outlined many good tools that could be used in the development of MetaGame and some projects that we might align nicely with our desired outcome.
Announcing this week's video call topics, location, and strategy:
We'll be exploring distribution channels and kicking things off.
Discussing website development moving forward.
Discussing what the MVP should be. 
The meeting time is 6PM UTC, 7PM CET, 1PM EST on Friday the 13th 👹*spooky*
The meeting room meet.jit.si/MetaGameWebConnect is where we’ll be.
We're trying the open source video conferencing tool Jitsi to make it easier for scheduling and sharing moving forward. 
Following this update you will also get a google calendar invite 📆 for the meeting or do it yourself below because, we’re super extra like that 👇🏼 



🚧 Genesis - week 1
Competition Time
We’ll likely be doing a small design competition (or co-creation) starting after tomorrow’s call (7pm CET). Everyone gets some Seeds and moves up the ladder, the winner gets some ETH and a ticket to Valhalla.
The invitation for the call should be in your inbox, but might in spam folder as it’s coming from pethereum@outlook.com not here 🤷‍♂️
Weekly Update
The most compressed introduction of MetaGame so far on Twitter, read it, like it, share it if you will 🍻
Great progress made on defining the user stories, mostly by Yalor 👏
Manu Alzuru moves from #10 Platinum Founding Father, to #7 Diamond; welcome to the top league hermano, try to keep it ;)
Punia does some design work on Figma and leaps from #14 Golden over Platinum, right up to #7 Platinum, sharing it with Manu with the exact same number of points 👍 - which one of you gets to keep it next week, tho?
Antiprosynthesis & Tom Howard go #20 & #19 to #16 & #15 respectively, right up to the border of going Golden to Platinum, but not quite over yet.
A fresh contributor named Rhys appears on the board at #40 Bronze, aiming at least for the Golden status, I hope 🙃
How do I move up the ladder?
Jump on call tomorrow, or at least retweet the above storm.
