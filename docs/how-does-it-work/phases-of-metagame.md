title: 🌒 Phases of MetaGame
---

## **Phase I: Seed**

> _Elon Musk: We spotted what appears to be an octopus at the edge of the Solar System. It looks like a baby but it's half the size of moon and it appears to be heading our way. Just 2020 things 🤷‍♂️_
> 
> Weeks later...
> 
> _NASA: This morning we’ve received a distress signal. After mocking our information technologies, she seemed to have started sobbing; claiming to be lost and dying of thirst._

The main goal of _Phase I_ is to build a hub for anyone interested in decentralized organizations & applications. A library of guides & portals to anything one might need to build them & a community of people to support them.

The meme of this phase is _A Decentralized Factory_; a collective of decentralized teams, churning out the building blocks we’re going to use to build a decentralized world.

### Goals:

-   Build a community of people strongly aligned with the _MetaManifesto_.
-   Set up the basic socio-economic infrastructure.
-   Assemble the initial resource base.
    

## **Phase II: Growth**

> _Gently, she descended into the Atlantic Ocean. We were worried about the oceanic life, but she assured us she only feeds on h2o & co2 - she doesn’t stop blowing our minds. First, her decentralized technologies, and now this? She might turn out more useful than we thought._

Proven ourselves worthy; _Seeds_ grow into _Trees_ & we summon _The Great Flood._  
A wave of capital flows into MetaGame and it allows us to pay even more people to do awesome things - like grappling with the real-world issues.

So we zoom out of crypto and start onboarding people from other high-tech, but also ecological & philanthropical communities; MetaGame starts looking more like a federation of guilds & alliances than one single community.

The meme is _A Web of Opportunity_; there is no lack of funding nor a lack of problems to solve. Anyone is able to just jump in, start solving problems & earning an income.

### Goals:

-   Summon _The Great Flood_.
-   Spread tentacles into all high-leverage technologies.
-   Start solving problems outside of crypto.
    

## **Phase III: Equilibrium**

> _It’s been years since we spotted her drifting towards us. Her technologies helped us overcome coordination failures & her presence here turned out greatly beneficial for our ecosystems. She’s all huge & covered in greenery now; looking more like a breathing landmass than an octopus._

MetaGame now really _is_ a _massive_ online coordination game. By now, we have onboarder players & guilds offering anything one might need to live a rich & meaningful life through MetaGame. Now, there’s anything from co-working & co-living arrangements to ecovillages, being offered & even built through MetaGame.

As the name suggests, MetaGame is no longer focused on rapid growth but sustainable growth in the state of equilibrium. It is able to thrive & grow without any additional injections of speculative capital.

The meme of this phase is _A Web of Life_ - to support life as a whole.

### Goals:

-   Support a mass of people in doing something meaningful & making a living.
-   Onboard co-working/co-living spaces as well as off-the-grid farms & eco-villages.
-   Get deep into ecological & philanthropic initiatives.
    If that’s what we’ve been doing by now, we should by now have built a big enough community to start tackling actually big problems such as global warming & poverty.
- Solving real world problems cannot easily be made self-sustainable.  
    This means we should be using our big MetaArmy to apply pressure to all the big corporations & rich people claiming to be philanthropists.  
    Making a lot of noise and calling everyone out.

## **Phase IV - MetaNet?**

You thought the previous phase was a moonshot, but now you’re here. By now, MetaGame is bumping shoulders with developing countries - it’s economy is bigger than some of the third world nations. This doesn’t mean we can now start absorbing these nation states into MetaGame, but simply help them deploy their own metagames using the MetaFrame.  
Of course, they would all be discoverable through the MetaNet, people playing MetaGame can simply use their existing profiles to log-in to other metagames etc.
