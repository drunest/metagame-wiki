MetaGame is an open-source framework for autonomous humans and decentralized organizations, to coordinate in creation and exchange of value with the least friction and most fun possible.

Or more simply: a sweet spot between a social network, a freelancing platform & a role playing game.

### *A Game To Change The Game*

MetaGame is the idea we can build a new world atop of the old one, a more collaborative, transparent & fun world, a world in which self interest of all players is better aligned with the common good. A world unrestricted by physical boundaries.


### *A Real-Life MMORPG*

Progressing and grinding through video games is way more fun than progressing and grinding through life.
Game designers have figured out how to hack the human brain's reward system to keep us hooked and motivated to progress through the game.

Real life is also like a game, and with [Ethereum], we now have the ability to add RPG game mechanics to real life to build a more intuitive and fun socioeconomic system than the one we have right now.

### *An Operating System For A Remote World*
The vision for MetaGame 1.0 is to be the *‚Äúvirtual Silicon Valley‚Äù* connecting all the fragmented pieces of Web3 and the people building them together, measuring and gamifying value creation (powered by [SourceCred]). This will be the main funnel for onboarding people into Web3 / The MetaVerse. Leaderboards, achievements, quests, and everything else we need to make it fun, engaging and rewarding. The whole thing being ‚Äúnoob friendly‚Äù and easy to use as any modern app/game.
